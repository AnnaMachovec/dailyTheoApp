Directed Study under Manijeh Keshtgari


Daily Theo App is an app created for the Christian who loves to look at quotes by the some of the greatest theologians 
and pastors.As of now, this was developed as a project for a directed study. I hope to do more with it when the time 
comes, but as of now this is what has been developed. I am very excited with how Daily Theo App turned out. I am also 
excited to see what more can be developed of it after this semester ends.

I knew basically no swift prior to the development of this project in August.
