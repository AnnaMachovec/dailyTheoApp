“Do you mortify; do you make it your daily work; be always at it whilst you live; cease not a day from this work; be killing sin or it will be killing you.”
“Set faith at work on Christ for the killing of thy sin. His blood is the great sovereign remedy for sin-sick souls. Live in this, and thou wilt die a conqueror; yea, thou wilt, through the good providence of God, live to see thy lust dead at thy feet.”
“There is no way of deliverance from the state and condition of being in the flesh, but by the Spirit of Christ.”
“Let not that man think he makes any progress in holiness who walks not over the bellies of his lusts.”
